# Command Line Interface (CLI)
Soup is at its core a command line application. The CLI is designed to be as clean and simple as possible while still allowing for easy execution of common build related tasks.

```
soup <command> [arguments]
```

* [Build](CLI/Build.md) - Perform a build with a specified root Package.

* [Initialize](CLI/Initialize.md) - Initialize a new Package with default properties.

* [Install](CLI/Install.md) - Install dependencies for a specified Package and all transitive references.

* [Publish](CLI/Publish.md) - Publish a given package to the public feed.

* [Run](CLI/Run.md) - Invoke the executable result (if applicable) for a specified package.

* [Version](CLI/Version.md) - Print the version of the current installed Soup application.
